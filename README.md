# Hubbard-Model-Josephson-Junction
In order to model a SMS Josephson Junction I applied the discrete Hubbard model to a linear lattice with site dependent 2-body potential. 
I wrote down the many-body Hamiltonian of the system, applied a mean-fied approximation and a particle-hole transformation, thus obtaining H = d* E d, where d is a vector of operators and E a matrix.
In order to diagonalize H, I numerically diagonalize E, using the unitary parameters to recursively calculate the mean field parameters.
